Hey There,I'M Talha,your Random Twitter Follower.
You Posted a problem on twitter few mins ago.


All you have to do is to Create a new div around your whole code. 

<div class="main_div">
// your whole code inside this div
</div>


After this,name this new div with a class "main_div".

Here is the css of new div
.main_div
{
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}
I hope its work.
